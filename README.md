# Belleza Global

## Description
Belleza Global is a mobile application developed using React Native and Expo.  
The app is designed to support the management of clients and appointment scheduling for a beauty service business.

The application allows the user to:
- Register and manage clients
- Create, edit, and view appointments
- Navigate a daily agenda organized in time blocks
- View dashboards with appointment summaries and statistics
- Store all data locally using SQLite for offline access

The app is designed as a single-user application and does not require authentication.

## Purpose
The purpose of this software is to strengthen mobile application development skills by designing and building a complete, functional solution that integrates user interface design, data persistence, and application logic.

This project focuses on applying software engineering principles such as modular architecture, state management, database integration, and debugging techniques, while creating a real-world style application that could be used in a small business environment.
